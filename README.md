### Project Title

US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project..


### Overview

In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for
three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

-The source code takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive experience.
-According to the input the code will import the data and will provide information by 
computing descriptive statistics.


### Description
The code developed takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal 
that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending 
on a user's input, the answers to the questions will change! There are four questions that 
will change the answers:

Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which you'll do data analysis. After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.
